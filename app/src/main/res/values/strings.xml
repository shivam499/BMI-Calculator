    <string name="bmr_ques"><![CDATA[What is BMR and How to Calculate?]]></string>
    <string name="bmr_ans"><![CDATA[BMR stands for Basal Metabolic Rate and represents the number of calories you would burn in a day if you were inactive and stayed in bed all day. The BMR calculator allows you to calculate not only the number of calories you burn when inactive, but also a daily calorie figure that takes into account your lifestyle activity level. These two figures together give you a representative figure for your daily calorie intake.<br/>
    the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is calculated by using the following formula:<br/><br/><b>Mifflin - St Jeor equation</b><br/><br/>
    10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(y) + 5 (man)<br/>
    10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(y) - 161 (woman)]]></string>

    <string name="cal_ans"><![CDATA[The Calorie Calculator can be used to estimate the calories you need to consume each day.
        The calories needed to maintain your weight equal to the BMR value, multiplied by an activity factor.
    The average male adult requires about 2,700 calories to maintain his weight, while the average female needs only 2,200 calories, according to the U.S Department of Health.

    <string name="ibw_ans"><![CDATA[IBW stands for Ideal Body Weight.
        The Ideal Body Weight Calculator computes the ideal body weight as well as a healthy body weight range based on height, gender, and age.
        However, there is still no definite answer regarding the "best" weight for a person. However, the results obtained by most formulas are very good.
        The Ideal Weight Calculator provides the results of all the popular formulas for comparison purposes.<br/><br/><b>J. D. Robinson Formula</b><br/><br/> 52 kg + 1.9 kg/inch over 5 feet (man)<br/>

    <string name="lbm_ans"><![CDATA[LBM stands for Lean Body Mass.The Lean Body Mass Calculator gives out the estimated Lean Body Mass (LBM) based on body weight, height, gender, and age. The Lean Body Mass (LBM) is a part of the body. It is normally defined to be the body weight minus the body fat. Typically lean body mass is 60 â€“ 90% of the total body mass. Normally, men have higher port of lean body mass than women. Some anaesthetic agents dosage, especially water-soluble drugs, are routinely based on the lean body mass value. ]]></string>

    <string name="bsa_ans"><![CDATA[BSA stands for Body Surface Area is the measured or calculated surface area of a human body. For many clinical purposes BSA is a better indicator of Kouro than body weight because it is less affected by abnormal adipose mass. Nevertheless, there have been several important critiques of the use of BSA in determining the dosage of medications with a narrow therapeutic index, such as chemotherapy.]]></string>
